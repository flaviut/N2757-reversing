# N2757 Reversing

Some notes on reverse-engineering the Agilent N2757 adaptor.

A partial netlist can be found in `netlist.csv`, and there's various relevant datasheets in here as well.

I've also included a few photos of the inside of the device. Unfortunately, all signals go through the inner two layers and can only be probed for.
